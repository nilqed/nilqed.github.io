DEFFUNCTION
===========

With the deffunction construct, new functions may be defined directly in

XSI. Deffunctions are equivalent in use to other functions in XSI.

The only differences between user-defined external functions and

deffunctions are that deffunctions are written in XSI and executed

by XSI interpretively and user-defined external functions are written

in an external language, such as C, and executed by XSI directly.

Also, deffunctions allow the addition of new functions without having to

recompile and relink XSI.

The syntax of the deffunction construct is:

::

   (deffunction <name> [<comment>]
       (<regular-parameter>* [<wildcard-parameter>])
       <action>*)

   <regular-parameter>  ::= <single-field-variable>
   <wildcard-parameter> ::= <multifield-variable>
