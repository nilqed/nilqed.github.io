Version M.m of XSI contains two major enhancements. First, XSI now
provides a mechanism which allows an embedded application to create
multiple environments into which programs can be loaded. Second, an
improved Windows 95/98/NT XSI interface is now available and the
Macintosh XSI interface has been enhanced to support MacOS X. For a
detailed listing of differences between the 6.x releases, refer to
appendix B of the *Basic Programming Guide* and appendix C of the
*Advanced Programming Guide*.
