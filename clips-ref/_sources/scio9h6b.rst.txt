DEFINSTANCES
============

Similar to deffacts, the definstances construct allows the specification
of

instances which will be created every time the reset command is
executed.

On every reset all current instances receive a delete message, and the

equivalent of a make-instance function call is made for every instance

specified in definstances constructs.

The syntax of the definstances construct is:

::

   <definstances-construct> 
                   ::= (definstances <definstances-name> [<comment>]
                          <instance-template>*)

   <instance-template>   ::= (<instance-definition>)

   <instance-definition> ::= <instance-name-expression> of
                                <class-name-expression>
                                <slot-override>*

   <slot-override>       ::= (<slot-name-expression> <expression>*)
