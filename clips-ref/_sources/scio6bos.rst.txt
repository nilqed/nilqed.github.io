With the defglobal construct, global variables can be defined, set, and

accessed within the XSI environment. Global variables can be accessed

as part of the pattern matching process, but changing them does not
invoke

the pattern matching process. The bind function is used to set the value

of global variables.

The syntax of the defglobal construct is:

::

   <defglobal-construct> ::= (defglobal [<defmodule-name>] 
                                <global-assignment>*)

   <global-assignment>   ::= <global-variable> = <expression>

   <global-variable>     ::= ?*<symbol>*
