DEFFACTS
========

With the deffacts construct, a list of facts can be defined which are

automatically asserted whenever the reset command is performed.

Facts asserted through deffacts may be retracted or pattern matched like

any other fact. The initial fact-list, including any defined deffacts,

is always reconstructed after a reset command.

The syntax of the deffacts construct is:

::

   (deffacts <deffacts-name> [<comment>]
      <RHS-pattern>*)
